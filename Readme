# Setting Up Webhooks using ngrok

When working with **Cashfree Webhooks** in a local development environment, we need to expose our local server to the internet. Since localhost is not publicly accessible, we use **ngrok** to create a secure tunnel.

## Step 1: Install ngrok (if not installed)

Download and install ngrok from: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

## Step 2: Start ngrok

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
ngrok http 3000

##step 2:update the craete order function inside paymentController.js file
        notify_url: `{urlcreated in ur  terminal}/api/cashfree-webhook`,


##step 3: add the ngrok url in cashfree account

```
